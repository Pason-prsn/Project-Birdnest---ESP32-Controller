Hello! This is project Birdnest, which is an ExpressLRS project that uses the DIY ESP32 E28 format. This format utalizes an ESP32 and the infomous E28 LORA transmitter module, but the catch is the ESP32 is coded as the controller!! The ESP32 can take arduino style modules such as a joystick, potentiometer, buttons, and LED signals. A schematic is shown below, with more information coming soon...
